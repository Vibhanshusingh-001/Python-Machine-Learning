### ML offers a new way to solve problems, answer complex questions, and create new content. ML can predict the weather, estimate travel times, recommend songs, auto-complete sentences, summarize articles, and generate never-seen-before images.




 `GridSearchCV`: Exhaustively tests hyperparameter combinations with cross-validation (used later, mplied).
 `StratifiedKFold`: A cross-validation splitter that preserves class proportions in each fold.
