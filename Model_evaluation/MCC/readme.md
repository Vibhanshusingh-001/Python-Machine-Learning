#  Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) in Machine Learning

MCC is especially valuable in dealing with **imbalanced datasets**, offering a more balanced evaluation of binary classification models.


## What is the Matthews Correlation Coefficient?

The **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)** is a measure of the quality of binary classifications.
It takes into account all four elements of a **confusion matrix**:

* True Positives (**TP**)
* True Negatives (**TN**)
* False Positives (**FP**)
* False Negatives (**FN**)

The MCC can be understood as a **correlation coefficient** between the predicted and actual classifications, ranging from **-1 to +1**:

* **+1** → Perfect predictions
* **0** → No better than random guessing
* **-1** → Total disagreement between predictions and true outcomes



## Mathematical Definition

The Matthews Correlation Coefficient is defined as:

$$MCC = \frac{TP \times TN - FP \times FN}{\sqrt{(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)}}$$




## Breakdown of the Formula

* **Numerator:**

  ```
  (TP * TN) - (FP * FN)
  ```

  This part rewards cases where the model gets both true positives and true negatives correct, while penalizing false positives and false negatives.

* **Denominator:**

  ```
  sqrt((TP + FP) * (TP + FN) * (TN + FP) * (TN + FN))
  ```

  This ensures that the MCC score is **normalized between -1 and +1**, making it interpretable.
  If all predictions are correct (both positives and negatives), the denominator scales accordingly, ensuring a perfect score.




## Why Use MCC?

Many traditional metrics (like **accuracy**) can be misleading when working with **imbalanced datasets**, where one class heavily outweighs the other.

For instance, in rare disease detection, accuracy might appear high even if the model predicts the majority class (negative cases) most of the time.

MCC solves this issue by considering the **balance between positive and negative classes**, offering a **more insightful and fair evaluation**.

Unlike accuracy, which can give inflated results for imbalanced data, MCC remains reliable **regardless of class distribution**.



## Key Benefits of MCC

* Handles **imbalanced datasets** effectively
* **Comprehensive:** Considers all four confusion matrix components
* **Unbiased:** Not influenced by class imbalance (unlike precision or accuracy)



## MCC vs Other Metrics

| Metric                 | Limitation                         | MCC Advantage                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**           | Misleading with imbalanced data    | Considers all confusion matrix values           |
| **Precision & Recall** | Focus on only positive predictions | Balances both positive and negative predictions |
| **F1-Score**           | Ignores true negatives             | Includes all confusion matrix terms             |



## When Should You Use MCC?

MCC is particularly useful when:

* **Working with imbalanced datasets:** Gives a realistic picture of model performance.
* **Binary classification tasks:** Though extendable to multi-class problems, MCC shines in binary settings.
* **Real-world scenarios:** Fraud detection, disease diagnosis, or spam filtering — all involve class imbalance.



## Example: MCC in Python

```python
from sklearn.metrics import matthews_corrcoef

# True and predicted labels
y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
y_pred = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Calculate MCC
mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Matthews Correlation Coefficient: {mcc}")
```
